File crippled_des.py have the following copyright notice:
    # Modified DES encryption for VNC password authentication.
    # Ported from realvnc's java viewer by <cliechti@gmx.net>
    # I chose this package name because it is not compatible with the
    # original DES algorithm, e.g. found pycrypto.
    # Original notice following:


    # This DES class has been extracted from package Acme.Crypto for use in VNC.
    # The bytebit[] array has been reversed so that the most significant bit
    # in each byte of the key is ignored, not the least significant.  Also the
    # unnecessary odd parity code has been removed.
